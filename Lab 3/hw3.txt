1. The original code without the changes would 
goto case_long_iso_time_style if the locale_format 
was same as the long_time_format. 
However since this condition will never be fulfilled 
and this part of the code is removed in the patch, 
the case would never be called and 
hence it was not necessary to remove it. 

2. If there are people who don't speak english, 
they may not be able to read the date 
as it is written out in english. 
Furthermore, if this patch is applied in countries that use dd-mm format 
instead of mm-dd, the patch may produce an incorrect date. 

3. Invoking randline.py on /dev/null 
returns IndexError: list index out of range. 
When return random.choice(self.lines) is called, in choice, 
return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] 
raises this error if the sequence is empty. 
Since this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, 
the sequence is empty and hence returns an erorr. 

4. Using python3 results in a syntax error 
at "except IOError as (errno, strerror):" 
The correct form for python 3 would be "except IOError as err:".  
Exceptions in Python 2 are iterable, 
but this breaks the explicit is better than implicit rule of Python 
and has as such been removed in Python 3.
