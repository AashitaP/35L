1. First I made another directory called coreutilsInstall, 
this will be used later to make sure the coreutils package 
is only installed in that directory and not the local server. 

2. Next I grab Coreutils 7.6 using 
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz. 
This creates another folder called coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
that I untarred using tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz. 
This created another temporary directory. 

3. I go into the directory using cd coreutils-7.6 and 
configure using ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classaas/coreutilsInstall. 
This configures the package in the coreutilsInstall directory created earlier. 

4. Following that I use make and make install to finish installing the package.

5. Doing ./src/ls -l shows the wrong date format 
which is for example 
-rw-r--r--  1 classaas class    3571 2009-09-01 04:01 AUTHORS. 

6. I created a patch file in coreutils-7.6 
using vim patch_file and copied Brady's patch into the file.

7. I applied the patch using patch -p1 < patch_file

8. I used the make command again.
Doing ./src/ls -l in the directory (coreutils-7.6)
shows the correct date format.  
If we go in the src directory and do ls -l we can see that the ls file 
has been modified and shows the last modification time as recently. 

9. ./src/ls -l gives the correct format (different format for old and new), 
touch new and ls -l gives 
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaas class    0 Jan 30 11:20 new 
touch old -d 1/30/1989 
and ls -l gives 
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaas class    0 Jan 30  1989 old
Newer files include the time and not the year, 
which is taken to be the current year. 
Older files include the year.
