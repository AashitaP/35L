1. first i followed the steps on piazza to set up the beaglebone
2. next to create a userid for my team member I followed the following steps: 

Generate public and private keys
$ ssh-keygen (by default saved to ~/.ssh/is_rsa and id_rsa.pub) 

This prompted to enter a passphrase that I left as empty.

Create an account for the client on the server
$ sudo useradd –d /home/aashitapatwari –m parth

$ sudo passwd parth

Create .ssh directory for new user
$ cd /home/aashitapatwari
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

Change ownership and permission on .ssh directory
$ sudo chown –R parth .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

3. To log in to my team member's server I used the following steps: 

Generate public and private keys
$ ssh-keygen

Copy your public key to the server for key-based authentication (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
$ ssh-copy-id –i apatwari@131.179.21.225

and was prompted to enter the password.

SSH to server
$ ssh apatwari@131.179.21.225

and I managed to login, evident from 

pringlesEdison:~$


4. For X11 session forwarding, I used the following command

 $ ssh –X apatwari@131.179.21.225

The instructions from my lab stated that I have to run the following commands on the remote host
$ xterm, $ gedit, $ firefox, etc.

However, my partner is using an edison instead of a beaglebone and I am unable to run the commands for some reason.
