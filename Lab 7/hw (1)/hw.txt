1. If other teams had just been observing the bytes going across the network, 
the network would still be secure as without the private key that is not sent
 across, they cannot decode the message. But observing the keystrokes would 
allow them to observe the passphrase and commands that I use and duplicate it 
to get hold of the private key and hence the network would not be secure. 
If i'm booting off USB, it will also be insecure as the other team would be able to access where the keys are stored and obtain the private key. 

2. The command has access to the public key and the account name associated but cannot determine that that name created the public key. 
To fix this, we could send a message to the specified account that is encrypted by the public key. 
Only if the account had created that key, would it have the corresponding private key and be able to decrypt the message. 
If some other account created the public key, it would not be able to decrypt the message.
