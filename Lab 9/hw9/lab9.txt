1. Clone the repository using git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git from my lab9 folder. 

2. cd into diffutils and run git log, to get log of changes to master branch, redirecting output into git-log.txt

3. run git tag, to generate list of tags used, redirecting output to git-tags.txt

4. searched git-log.txt for the required commit to get the hash number for the commit - 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f

5. did git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt that created the patch file. 

6. git checkout v3.0 -b diff to checkout version 3.0 of diffutils into a branch named diff

7. applied the patch using patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt. After skipping past those that it was not able to figure out what file to patch, 
the following output was produced

can't find file to patch at input line 35
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

|commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
|Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
|Date:   Wed Jan 25 23:46:16 2012 -0800
|
|    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
|    
|    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
|    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
|    `like this' or ``like this''.
|    * HACKING, NEWS, README, README-hacking, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note:

|    Quote 'like this' or "like this" in commentary.
|    * cfg.mk (old_NEWS_hash): Adjust to reflect new NEWS quoting.
|    * man/help2man: Update to 1.40.4 version, with quoting fixed as above.
|    * po/en.po: Remove translation involving `, as it's no longer needed.

9. Next, to use emacs to revert all changes made to non .c files,I used the commands vc-diff (C-x v =) (which shows the changes made) and vc-revert (C-x v u) (to revert the changes made) to 

NEWS
README
TODO
doc/diagmeet.note
ms/config.bat
ms/config.site
po/en.po
src/diff.h
src/system.h
tests/help-version 

10. To undo all changes to .c files other than changes to character string constants, I went through each .c file 
and determined whether a specific hunk should be discarded or not using diff-apply-hunk in the vc-diff buffer (C-c C-a) to apply the hunk 
(or do nothing if it is already applied) and C-u C-c C-a to revert the hunk.

I did this for 

src/analyze.c
src/cmp.c
src/context.c
src/diff.c
src/diff3.c
src/dir.c
src/ifdef.c
src/io.c
src/sdiff.c
src/side.c 
src/util.c

11. Next I used emacs to examine src/diff.c.rej, src/diff3.c.rej and copy rejected patches manually into the corresponding .c files as needed.


12. I use git clean -f to remove all untracked files. 
Doing git status to check shows the 6 modified files. 

	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/util.c

13. I put the output of git diff into a file using git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt. 
Doing wc -l < quote-3.0-patch.txt
326

confirms that my patch is 300-400 lines long. 

14. Using the commands in README-hacking, (after applying export PATH="/usr/local/cs/bin/:$PATH")

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

I build a modified version of Diffutils. 

To verify, 

diff .- and diff --help both don't use ` instead of '. 

15.  I then put the former source code into a directory diffutils-3.0 and the latter source code into a directory diffutils-3.0-patch, 
and run “D/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt”, where the D is the directory containing my diff implementation.

When I compare quote-3.0-test.txt against quote-3.0-patch.txt, the only differences are the use of backticks and apostraphes. Thus the differences are innocuous.
