wget -O assign2.txt 
http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html: 
to take a text file containing the html in the assignment's web page


GIVEN COMMANDS: 

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt : tr to translate, 
man tr to see what c option does, 
it uses complement of the first set which is A-Za-z, 
which means all non letters are translated into newline characters


tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt: 
man tr to see what cs option does, 
s replaces each sequence of a repeated character 
that is listed in the last specified SET, 
with a single occurrence of that character, 
which means that multiple repeated non letters 
are not replaces with multiple new lines, just one. 


tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort : 
sorts the previous output in alphabetical order 
such that there is only one word in each line. 

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u: 
removes repeated words in the sorted version

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u | comm - words : 
man comm, comm compares 2 sorted files line by line, 
the first column shows the words unique to the HTML page, 
the second column shows the words unique to the words file 
and the last column shows the lines that appear in both files. 


tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u | comm -23 - words : 
man comm, 
adding -23 suppresses column 2 and column 3 
and hence only shows the words unique to the HTML page. 


wget -O hawa.txt http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm 
to extract hawaiian words

BUILDWORDS: 

follow each command with a pipe '|'

1) sed '/<!DOCTYPE/,/Adopt<\/td>/d': 
to remove the first few lines until the first hawaiian word
2) sed '/<tr>/,/<\/td>/d' : 
to remove all the english words
3) tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' : translate all upper case to lower case
4) sed 's/<u>//g' : 
to remove <u> 
5) sed 's/<\/u>//g' : to remove </u> 
6) sed s/\`/\'/g : to replace ` with ' 
7) sed 's/, /\n/g' : treat words separated by commas or spaces 
as two different words by replacing with newline character
8) sed 's/ /\n/g' : treat words separated by commas or spaces 
as two different words by replacing with newline character
9) sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' : 
to remove all html tags
10) sed '/www\./,/letter\./d' : to remove the last few lines
11) sed 's/^\s*//g' : to remove leading space
12) sed '/^$/d' : to remove empty lines
13) grep -v "[^pk'mnwlhaeiou]"  : 
removes all lines with non hawaiian letters
14) sort -u


ls -l : to see the buildwords is not executable so we use chmod +x buildwords

To make the hawaiian words dictionary using the executable 
I used cat hawa.txt | ./buildwords > hwords 
such that hwords contains the dictionary. 


SPELL CHECKERS:

The web page is already retrieved as assign2.txt. 

To run the spell checker on this webpage,
I use the command tr -cs "/'pkmnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | 
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords. 
I redirected the output into file misshawa.txt 
and used wc -l to count the number of misspelled hawaiian words. 

For english words I used a similar approach. 
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt 
| sort -u | comm -23 - words > misseng.txt 
followed by wc -l misseng.txt

Number of misspelled hawaiian words is 200. 
Number of misspelled english words is 81. 

There are words misspelled in english 
but not in hawaiian such as wiki, halau 
and words misspelled in hawaiian but not english such as eep and ample.
