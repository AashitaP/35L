1) Measure any differences in performance between sfrob and sfrobu using the time command. Run your program on inputs of varying numbers of input lines. 

I created two files - file1 with 7 lines and file2 with 406 lines. 

time ./sfrob < file1.txt

real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.000s

time ./sfrob < file2.txt

real	0m0.003s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.003s

time ./sfrobu < file1.txt

real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.001s

time ./sfrobu < file2.txt

real	0m0.010s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.008s


sfrobu takes longer.


2) estimate the number of comparisons as a function of the number of input lines.

I used strace for this. 

for file1 sfrob has 42 lines of output and sfrobu 124. 
for file2 sfrob has 447, sfrobu 9695. 

Using the larger file as a better estimate, sfrob makes about one comparison per input line
and sfrobu makes about 20. 

3) Use the time command to compare the overall performance of sfrob, sfrobu, sfrobs, sfrobu -f, and sfrobs -f.

time ./sfrob < file2.txt

real	0m0.004s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.000s

time ./sfrobu < file2.txt

real	0m0.010s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.007s

time ./sfrobs < file2.txt

real	0m0.009s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.007s

time ./sfrobu -f < file2.txt

real	0m0.010s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.007s

time ./sfrobs -f < file2.txt

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.007s

sfrob is the fastest. sfrobs and sfrobu have similar performance. 
Adding the flag does not change sfrobu but makes sfrobs faster.
