1. man -k (keyword)
I typed man man to see the manual for "man" and get the answer. 
for example man -k printf
prints out all the commands with printf in their man page. 

2. which cp (/usr/local/cs/bin/cp) and 
which wc (/usr/local/cs/bin/wc)
I tried the commands with whereis as well, 
but that gave extra information that was not necessary. 

3. From the previous question,
 I inferred it might be located in usr/bin directory 
 and did cd /usr/bin and ls to confirm. 
I used man find to look through the directory to figure out the find command,
which is find . -name '?' -executable. 

The programs are:

./w

I used man w. 
This program shows who is logged on and what they are doing. 

./X

Doing ls -l shows th
at X is a symbolic link to Xorg. 
So I used man Xorg. 
This program is the X11R7 X server that was originally designed for UNIX 
and UNIX-like operating systems running on Intel x86 hardware.

./[

man [ showed that it was a bash builtin command. 

4. Reading off the results of the previous ls -l command, 
we see that emacs is a symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/emacs. 
Going into that using cd /etc/alternatives and doing ls -l again, 
emacs is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/emacs-24.3. 
/usr/bin/emacs-24.3 is not linked to anything else. 
Hence, emacs-24.3 is actually executed.

5. g+s: sets group ID on execution,
which means that it grants permission of the group that own’s the file, 
o-x: changes permission so that users who are not the owner of the file 
or members of the group can't execute

6. Looking through the manual of find, the command is find -mtime -21 -type f. 
The minus sign before 21 is so that it displays files within the last 3 weeks. 
Type f is for file type. 

7. find -mtime -21 -type d
Type d is for directory type. 

8. which find to get which directory it is in, 
ouputs /usr/bin/find. 
man find to find the commands. 
find /usr/bin -type l > links.txt 
to put all the files that are symbolic links into links.txt. 
wc -l links.txt 
to count the number of files/lines. 
The answer is 246. 

9. I used cd /usr/lib to get into the directory. 
man ls to read through the manual. 
ls -lt would list, sorted by modification time, newest first. 
the first file on the bottom that is not a directory 
(no d in the front) 
is the oldest regular file. 

The answer is libgpg-error.so.0.10.0. 

10. man locale to read the manual. 
locale gets its data from environment variable,
which is localedef (man -k locale). 
man localedef. 
The program reads the indicated charmap and input files, 
and compiles them to a binary form quickly usable by the locale function. 
So data comes from charmap and input files.  

11. C-h ? to see what command to use. 
Typing a sort shows commands with sort in their name. 
C-x o to switch buffers. 
The commands are: 

Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
sort-columns                  M-x ... RET
sort-fields                   M-x ... RET
sort-lines                   
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET
sort-pages                    M-x ... RET
sort-paragraphs               M-x ... RET
sort-regexp-fields            M-x ... RET
tabulated-list-col-sort       M-x ... RET
tabulated-list-sort           M-x ... RET

12. C-h r to browse through the emacs manual. 
C-h k KEY lists descriptions of each keystroke. 
C-h K KEY also display descriptions. 
I chose to go with the latter for all the keys except C-M-c.  


‘C-M-a’
Move to beginning of current or preceding defun (‘beginning-of-defun’).

‘C-M-b’
Move backward over a balanced expression (‘backward-sexp’).

'C-M-c'
C-M-c runs the command exit-recursive-edit (found in global-map),
which is an interactive built-in function in ‘C source code’.

'C-M-d' 
To move _down_ in the parenthesis structure (‘down-list’).

‘C-M-e’
Move to end of current or following defun (‘end-of-defun’).

‘C-M-f’
 Move forward over a balanced expression (‘forward-sexp’).

'C-M-g' does not exist

‘C-M-h’
 Put region around whole current or following defun (‘mark-defun’).


13. C-h K C-g to display description. C-x o to switch buffers. 

"Quitting with ‘C-g’ is the way to get rid of a partially typed
command, or a numeric argument that you don’t want.  Furthermore, if you
are in the middle of a command that is running, ‘C-g’ stops the command
in a relatively safe way.  For example, if you quit out of a kill
command that is taking a long time, either your text will _all_ still be
in the buffer, or it will _all_ be in the kill ring, or maybe both.  If
the region is active, ‘C-g’ deactivates the mark, unless Transient Mark
mode is off (see Disabled Transient Mark).  If you are in the middle
of an incremental search, ‘C-g’ behaves specially; it may take two
successive ‘C-g’ characters to get out of a search.""

14. C-h r to browse through manual. 
C-h f yank to search by function name. 

Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  

15. invoke the dired command in emacs using C-x d. 
For example, the directory listing in emacs shows 

dired : 
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       41496 Jun 30  2016 [
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 root root      107856 Mar  2  2017 a2p
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       52640 Oct  3 06:37 ab

ls -l:

 -rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       41496 Jun 30  2016 '['
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root      107856 Mar  2  2017  a2p
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       52640 Oct  3 06:37  ab

ls -l displays 301660 results 
while the dired command displays 301736. 
Apart from that, there is no difference.
