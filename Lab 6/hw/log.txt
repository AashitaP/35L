1. checked the version using sort --version

2. to generate 10,000,000 random single precision floating numbers 
with one per line I used the command 
od -An -t f4 -N 40000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > lab6.txt 
since each floating point number is 4 bytes. 
The od command generates numbers and tr is used to replace spaces with newlines

3. Doing wc -l < lab6.txt shows that there are 10,000,001 lines so to delete one line I use the command sed '1d' lab6.txt > lab6lines.txt and confirm that there are 10,000,000 lines in lab6lines.txt

4. Next we have to time the sort command with --parallel and -g options. I run the time command 5 times, once without the parallel option specifying different number of threads 1,2,4 and 8. 

The command used is: 
time -p /usr/local/cs/bin/sort -g --parallel=2 la6lines.txt > /dev/null


				no parallelism 	Parallel = 1 	Parallel = 2 	Parallel = 4 	Parallel = 8
real 			20.89			102.96			56.20		    33.21			22.21
user 			113.64			102.76			106.72.         111.78			114.00
sys 			0.44			0.18			0.27.           0.36			0.44


Real time decreases with more parallel options and system time increases. Though without the paralell option, real time is the lowest.
